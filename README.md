## **Methodology**

The Smart Blind Stick combines multiple sensors and IoT capabilities to provide real-time feedback and emergency support. The system is designed with simplicity and efficiency in mind, ensuring reliable operation in various environments.

---

## **How It Works**

### **Obstacle Detection**
- **Ultrasonic Sensors**: Three sensors are strategically placed to detect obstacles at different heights.
- **Alert Mechanism**: The buzzer sounds and the vibrator motor vibrates when an obstacle is detected, providing immediate feedback to the user.
- **Distance Calculation**: The distance to the obstacle is calculated using the formula:  
  `Distance = (Time √ó Speed of Sound) / 2`.

### **Emergency Assistance**
- **GPS and Wi-Fi Connection**: Upon powering on, the NodeMCU connects to Wi-Fi, and the GPS module starts receiving location data.
- **Emergency Button**: Pressing the button triggers a Webhook request to the IFTTT server, sending an alert message with GPS coordinates to the designated contact.

## **Results**

The Smart Blind Stick offers a practical and effective solution to enhance the daily lives of visually impaired individuals. It is both cost-efficient and accessible, combining essential features like obstacle detection and emergency assistance into a single, user-friendly device.

---

## **Conclusion**

The Smart Blind Stick is a transformative tool designed to improve the quality of life for visually impaired individuals by enhancing their independence and safety. It addresses common challenges with an innovative approach, offering a meaningful impact on the user's daily life.
