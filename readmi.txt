Introduction
Approximately 253 million people around the world live with visual impairments, making daily navigation a significant challenge. The Smart Blind Stick project aims to enhance the independence and safety of visually impaired individuals by providing a cost-effective, easy-to-use solution. This smart stick is equipped with advanced sensors and IoT technology to detect obstacles and send emergency notifications to caregivers.

Features
Obstacle Detection: Ultrasonic sensors detect obstacles within 100 cm, providing timely alerts through a buzzer and vibrator motor.
Emergency Assistance: GPS module and NodeMCU ESP8266 send the user's location to a designated contact when the emergency button is pressed.
User-Friendly Design: Lightweight, budget-friendly, and easy to assemble, making it accessible to a wide audience.
Components
NodeMCU ESP8266
GPS Module
Ultrasonic Sensors
Buzzer
Vibrator Motor
Emergency Button



How It Works
Obstacle Detection
Ultrasonic Sensors: Three sensors detect obstacles at different heights.
Alert Mechanism: When an obstacle is detected, the buzzer sounds and the vibrator motor vibrates, alerting the user.
Distance Calculation: The distance to the obstacle is calculated using the formula: Distance = (Time Ã— Speed of Sound) / 2.
Emergency Assistance
GPS and Wi-Fi Connection: When the stick is powered on, the NodeMCU connects to Wi-Fi, and the GPS module begins receiving location data.
Emergency Button: Pressing the emergency button triggers a Webhook request to the IFTTT server, which sends an alert message with GPS coordinates to the designated contact.
Results
The Smart Blind Stick provides a practical solution to simplify the lives of visually impaired individuals. It combines essential features at a minimal cost, making it accessible to a broader audience. The obstacle detection system effectively alerts users to nearby hazards, while the emergency button ensures help is always just a press away.

Conclusion
The Smart Blind Stick is a transformative tool for visually impaired individuals, enhancing their independence and safety. By addressing common challenges faced in daily life, this project offers a meaningful impact on the quality of life for blind individuals.
